# TickHelp
Swift Application that is written in IOS for ECE 158B Data Networks class.

# What is TickHelp?
Tickhelp is an iOS App that allows its users to connect with each other without the use of internet. It forms a local mesh network
among users with the help of Apple's Multipeer Connectivity framework. Once detected internet connection, the app uses GeoFire to update
users current location to a backend server and retrive other users information in real-time to approximate locations.
